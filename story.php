                    that emotional support shouldn't be a luxury<br>
                    afforded to only a few.It shouldn't be <br>

                    counselors aren't the best because of the number <br>
                    of degrees they have hanging on the wall.<br>
                    They're the best because they have an <br>
                    exceptional ability to be warm, empathetic<br>
                    understanding when someone is in emotional<br>

                    based on the knowledge that attention from a<br>
