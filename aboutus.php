        MentaAid is a subsidiary of ZindukaHub that seeks t promote mental
        health awareness amongest students in secondary schools.We achieve
        this by having mentorship programs with the students, training peer councellors,
        conducting personal and group councelling sessions.This, we believe,
        will help reduce some of the social issues in schools such as teenage
        pregnancy, drug abuse, bullying and the likes.
